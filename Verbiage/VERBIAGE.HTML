<P>Northwestern IT support is requesting that you please upgrade your macOS to the latest available version.  This will ensure that the computer has the latest security and feature updates installed.  Please select "Restart"  to initiate the installation of the latest macOS.  Please note that, while the download has occured in the background allowing you to continue working, the upgrade may take up to 30 minutes to complete and will briefly interrupt your work cycle.  You also have the option to temporarily defer the upgrade by selecting "Defer". If you require assistance, please send an email to consultant@northwestern.edu</p>
